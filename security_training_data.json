Generally, this involves consuming system resources such as CPU utilization, memory, file-system quotas,\nor other system processes. Oftentimes, attackers have legitimate access to a finite quantity of system resources. However, the attackers abuse this access to consume additional\nresources. Thus, the system or legitimate users are deprived of their share of resources.\nResource starvation DoS attacks generally result in an unusable resource because the system crashes, the file system becomes full, or processes become hung.\n\nProgramming Flaws\nProgramming flaws are failures of an application, operating system, or embedded logic\nchip to handle exceptional conditions. These exceptional conditions normally result when\nrabilities and methods attackers can use to exploit these vulnerabilities and gain privileged access. This list is fairly comprehensive,\nbut there is a multitude of ways attackers could compromise the security of a vulnerable\nsystem. A system can be compromised because of poor configuration and administration\npractices.

Conventional wisdom suggests that merely applying\nstandard cryptography to the file systems of mobile computers will solve\nthe problem, but we have heard many times before that mere use of en-\ncryption will solve a problem. Often, the practical use of cryptography is\nmore complex than it seems at first sight. Some likely complexities that\nshould be addressed relate to key management for this environment (if the\nkeys encrypting the data are stored on the machine in readily available\nform, the cryptography is of little value), usability (encrypted data is of\nlimited use), and purging all traces of the unencrypted form of the dataSecurity and Privacy for Mobile and Wireless Networks 15\n(caching is widely used at many levels in modern computer systems).\nSimilarly, the simple claim that security cables will solve the problem re-\nnetworking problem altogether by\nenforcing stringent authentication schemes at the end points.\n8.3.2.1 Resource/Content Protection and Access Control\nIn the world of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, data is often at risk for\ndisclosure or tampering. Data lives on mobile and portable devices and may\nbe subject to theft. One approach to protecting the privacy of user data is to\nintegrate the protection mechanisms with the resources themselves.\nSecure File Systems\u2014Cryptographically secure file systems have been\navailable for more than ten years [3, 36]. In practice, though, such file sys-\ntems are not widely in use. Furthermore, even when such systems are used,\nit is common for users to store sensitive key material on the same device\nthat is being protected. As a result, when devices are lost or stolen, it is178 Ramakrishna, Eustice and Schnaider\nlikely that the information on those devices can be easily accessed by even\nmodestly skilled attackers.\n\nQuestion: How do you detect and prevent encrypting security breaches?"

Encryption key length should be determined based on\nthe amount of time the data remains sensitive\u2014shorter encryption key lengths (40 bits)\nare permissible for encrypting data streams that contain rapidly outdated data and will\nalso boost performance.\nSecure Shell (SSH) has long served the UNIX community where encrypted remote\nlogin was needed. Free versions for noncommercial, educational use can be found at\nhttp://www.ssh.org/download.html, while a commercial version called F-Secure Tunnel & Terminal is sold by Data Fellows, http://www.datafellows.com/. OpenSSH is a\nfree open-source alternative pioneered by the OpenBSD team and can be found at\nwww.openssh.com.\n\n\fChapter 8:\n\nHacking UNIX\n\nThe IP Security Protocol (IPSec) is a peer-reviewed proposed Internet standard that\nague\nidea of what information is actually on that lost laptop, and thus the magni-\ntude of the theft. Conventional wisdom suggests that merely applying\nstandard cryptography to the file systems of mobile computers will solve\nthe problem, but we have heard many times before that mere use of en-\ncryption will solve a problem. Often, the practical use of cryptography is\nmore complex than it seems at first sight. Some likely complexities that\nshould be addressed relate to key management for this environment (if the\nkeys encrypting the data are stored on the machine in readily available\nform, the cryptography is of little value), usability (encrypted data is of\nlimited use), and purging all traces of the unencrypted form of the dataSecurity and Privacy for Mobile and Wireless Networks 15\n(caching is widely used at many levels in modern computer systems).\nSimilarly, the simple claim that security cables will solve the problem re-\nnetworking problem altogether by\nenforcing stringent authentication schemes at the end points.\n8.3.2.1 Resource/Content Protection and Access Control\nIn the world of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, data is often at risk for\ndisclosure or tampering. Data lives on mobile and portable devices and may\nbe subject to theft. One approach to protecting the privacy of user data is to\nintegrate the protection mechanisms with the resources themselves.\nSecure File Systems\u2014Cryptographically secure file systems have been\navailable for more than ten years [3, 36]. In practice, though, such file sys-\ntems are not widely in use. Furthermore, even when such systems are used,\nit is common for users to store sensitive key material on the same device\nthat is being protected. As a result, when devices are lost or stolen, it is178 Ramakrishna, Eustice and Schnaider\nlikely that the information on those devices can be easily accessed by even\nmodestly skilled attackers.\n\nQuestion: How would you implement secure encrypting in a production environment?"

End-to-end data packet latency\nIn Fig. 9.7, we show the average end-to-end data packet latency under\ndifferent traffic loads. Since the network is static, there is no routing delay.\nWe also ignore the CPU processing delay at each intermediate node.\nTherefore, the end-to-end packet latency here includes queueing delays,\nretransmission delays and propagation delays. It is shown that, on the\naverage, our scheme has much higher packet latency than unreliable, pure202 Jiang\nbroadcast scheme. This is caused by retransmission and batching. When\nthe minimal polling set size increases, the packet latency increases very\nfast, especially when traffic load is high. The reason is that a larger polling\nn mobility increases. This is natu-\nral as increasing mobility will cause more packet loss.\nFigure 6.3 illustrates the data packet latency. As SDAR uses public key\ncryptography throughout the round trip of route discovery, a node needs to\nwait longer time before a route is established. ANODR shows a shorter av-\nerage data packet latency because it only uses public key encryp-\ntion/decryption when forwarding route reply messages. ANODR-KPS has\nnearly the same data packet delay with the original AODV, thanks to the\nefficient symmetric encryption algorithms and hash functions used. When\nthere is little mobility, all protocols display small data packet latency,134 Kong et al.\nbecause once a route is established, a stable network allows a longer aver-\nage route lifetime. When mobility increases, data packet latency increases\naccordingly. The latency trend slows down in high mobility because more\ndata packets are lost due to mobility. Packets with shorter routes are more\nthe processing and routing\nof packets. The following list enumerates the possibilities:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nPRE_ROUTING: Activates before the packet enters the routing subsystem of the kernel.\nLOCAL_IN: Activates for packets that are sent to the computer itself, and it is the last\n\nhook before a process receives the packet\u2019s data.\nFORWARD: Activates before a packet is forwarded to another machine.\nLOCAL_OUT: Activates for packets generated on the local machine.\nPOST_ROUTING: Activates right before a packet is sent out on the network.\n\nWhen a hook is activated, it must decide what the kernel should do with the examined\npacket.

Conversely, a conservative\npolicy could result in more privacy but a lower probability of a successful\ninteraction because neither entity will be able to gain sufficient trust in the\nother. Also, in order to be absolutely secure, many security decisions will\nhave to be made explicitly by the user, which is contrary to the ubiquitous\ncomputing goal of reducing human intervention. Many applications will\nalso require the free exchange of privileged information such as location,\nlocal capabilities, and constraints. Applications could run in an automated\nfashion if free exchanges were allowed, but privacy constraints could force\na more conservative approach. Various service discovery and access\nmechanisms could also result in inadvertent exposure of private content\nand resources, owing to careless design or a lax policy. Submitting to pri-\nvacy demands could detract from the user experience by restricting the\ncalls the PolicyMaker after\ncomposing the action string and determining the identity, from which the\ndesired action originated. Finally, PolicyMaker decides whether the action\nstring is permitted according the local security policy. The basic function\nof the PolicyMaker system is to process queries composed with the Poli-\ncyMaker Language of the form:\nkey , key , \u2026, key REQUEST Action String\n1 2 n\nA query is a request for information about the trust that can be placed in\na certain public-key. The PolicyMaker system processes queries based on\ntrust information that is included in assertions. Assertions assign authority\non keys and are of the form:\nSource ASSERTS AuthorityStruct WHERE Filter\nIn this context, each a credential is a type of assertion, which binds a\nfilter to a sequence of public-keys, called an authority structure. Source52 Spiewak and Engel\nindicates the origin of the assertion and AuthorityStruct specifies the public-\nkey(s) to whom the assertion applies\nity to distinguish between the signatures of dif-\nferent entities depending on the required services. By this means for in-\nstance, network entity A may trust certificates signed by network entity B\nfor small transaction but may insist upon certificates from more reliable\nnetwork entity C for large transactions.\nBasically, the PolicyMaker service appears to applications like a data-\nbase query engine and functions as a trust management engine. The input\nis composed of a set of local policy statements (credentials) as well as a\nstring describing the desired trusted action.

Conversely, a conservative\npolicy could result in more privacy but a lower probability of a successful\ninteraction because neither entity will be able to gain sufficient trust in the\nother. Also, in order to be absolutely secure, many security decisions will\nhave to be made explicitly by the user, which is contrary to the ubiquitous\ncomputing goal of reducing human intervention. Many applications will\nalso require the free exchange of privileged information such as location,\nlocal capabilities, and constraints. Applications could run in an automated\nfashion if free exchanges were allowed, but privacy constraints could force\na more conservative approach. Various service discovery and access\nmechanisms could also result in inadvertent exposure of private content\nand resources, owing to careless design or a lax policy. Submitting to pri-\nvacy demands could detract from the user experience by restricting the\ncalls the PolicyMaker after\ncomposing the action string and determining the identity, from which the\ndesired action originated. Finally, PolicyMaker decides whether the action\nstring is permitted according the local security policy. The basic function\nof the PolicyMaker system is to process queries composed with the Poli-\ncyMaker Language of the form:\nkey , key , \u2026, key REQUEST Action String\n1 2 n\nA query is a request for information about the trust that can be placed in\na certain public-key. The PolicyMaker system processes queries based on\ntrust information that is included in assertions. Assertions assign authority\non keys and are of the form:\nSource ASSERTS AuthorityStruct WHERE Filter\nIn this context, each a credential is a type of assertion, which binds a\nfilter to a sequence of public-keys, called an authority structure. Source52 Spiewak and Engel\nindicates the origin of the assertion and AuthorityStruct specifies the public-\nkey(s) to whom the assertion applies\nity to distinguish between the signatures of dif-\nferent entities depending on the required services. By this means for in-\nstance, network entity A may trust certificates signed by network entity B\nfor small transaction but may insist upon certificates from more reliable\nnetwork entity C for large transactions.\nBasically, the PolicyMaker service appears to applications like a data-\nbase query engine and functions as a trust management engine. The input\nis composed of a set of local policy statements (credentials) as well as a\nstring describing the desired trusted action. After evaluating the input, the\nPolicyMaker system finally returns either a yes/no answer or propositions\nthat make the desired action feasible.\nAll security policies are defined in terms of predicates, called filters that\nare combined with public-keys.

This plugin operates the same as linux_recover_filesystem (which\nwas discussed in Chapter 24) in that it recovers the full file system structure, including\nmetadata, to the directory that the user specifies. Using the gathered metadata (MAC\ntimes, file owner and permission, etc\nth exception\nof unallocated space and files that weren\u2019t memory-resident). You can then process your\nsimulated disk with forensics tools such as The Sleuth Kit (see http://www.sleuthkit.org).\n\n\fFile Systems in Memory\n\nWARNING\nIn order to fully replicate metadata, such as the owner and group of root-owned files,\nlinux_recover_filesystem must be run as root. In the case of kernel-level rootkits, the\nfile system you recover from memory can be fully attacker-controlled. For safety and\nstability purposes, you should extract the file system to its own partition, not the one\nfrom which you are analyzing. linux_recover_filesystem makes an effort to prevent\nattacks such as directory traversal, but you should exercise caution when analyzing\nthe file system. If you want to avoid this potential attack, you can comment out the\nline of the plugin that calls os.chown.\n\nBuilding Timelines\nBy using the linux_dentry_cache plugin, you can build timelines from the file system\u2019s\nmemory-resident artifacts\nd segment and\nhow attackers can gain access to systems by submitting commands to be executed locally\nor by simply taking over a connection. These types of attacks are trivial on shared segment networks and can be resolved as trivially with switched network hardware.\nWe also covered steps that can be taken if a break-in is suspected. Ridding a system of\nan unauthorized presence is extremely difficult, but we\u2019ve provided the most efficient\nmechanisms for doing so in this chapter. The main points are highlighted next. Nevertheless, your best bet is still complete reinstallation from original media.\n\u25bc\n\nAudit user accounts for superuser privilege or group membership. Delete any\nsuspicious accounts, and keep the number of privileged users on a system to a\nminimum.\n\n\u25a0\n\nScour startup configuration files for suspicious entries\u2014this is the primary\nplace that installed back doors will leave a signature, because most will want to\nbe restarted at system boot.\n\n563\n\n\f564\n\nQuestion: What are best practices for recovery), security?"

This plugin operates the same as linux_recover_filesystem (which\nwas discussed in Chapter 24) in that it recovers the full file system structure, including\nmetadata, to the directory that the user specifies. Using the gathered metadata (MAC\ntimes, file owner and permission, etc\nth exception\nof unallocated space and files that weren\u2019t memory-resident). You can then process your\nsimulated disk with forensics tools such as The Sleuth Kit (see http://www.sleuthkit.org).\n\n\fFile Systems in Memory\n\nWARNING\nIn order to fully replicate metadata, such as the owner and group of root-owned files,\nlinux_recover_filesystem must be run as root. In the case of kernel-level rootkits, the\nfile system you recover from memory can be fully attacker-controlled. For safety and\nstability purposes, you should extract the file system to its own partition, not the one\nfrom which you are analyzing. linux_recover_filesystem makes an effort to prevent\nattacks such as directory traversal, but you should exercise caution when analyzing\nthe file system. If you want to avoid this potential attack, you can comment out the\nline of the plugin that calls os.chown.\n\nBuilding Timelines\nBy using the linux_dentry_cache plugin, you can build timelines from the file system\u2019s\nmemory-resident artifacts\nd segment and\nhow attackers can gain access to systems by submitting commands to be executed locally\nor by simply taking over a connection. These types of attacks are trivial on shared segment networks and can be resolved as trivially with switched network hardware.\nWe also covered steps that can be taken if a break-in is suspected. Ridding a system of\nan unauthorized presence is extremely difficult, but we\u2019ve provided the most efficient\nmechanisms for doing so in this chapter. The main points are highlighted next. Nevertheless, your best bet is still complete reinstallation from original media.\n\u25bc\n\nAudit user accounts for superuser privilege or group membership. Delete any\nsuspicious accounts, and keep the number of privileged users on a system to a\nminimum.\n\n\u25a0\n\nScour startup configuration files for suspicious entries\u2014this is the primary\nplace that installed back doors will leave a signature, because most will want to\nbe restarted at system boot.\n\n563\n\n\f564\n\nQuestion: Explain the security implications of recovery),."

Full realization of this crucial property requires determining the\nmost appropriate incentives for volunteers and enforcements for\nconscripts.\n5.2.2.4 Preventing Unintended Consequences of Integrating Helpers\nExamples of unintended consequences when integrating helpers are\ndisruptions of operations of life-support and life-saving systems, traffic\nlights, utilities, PTSN and cell phones, the Internet, etc. [32].\nTo protect critical operations of oppnets and of helpers joining an\noppnet, oppnets must obey the following principles:92 Lilien et al.\n\u2022 Oppnets must not disrupt critical operations of potential helpers.\nIn particular, they must not take over any resources of life-\nsupport and life-saving systems.\n\u2022 For potential helpers running non-critical services, risk evaluation\nmust be performed by an oppnet before they are asked or ordered\nto join the oppnet\n\nQuestion: What security controls should be implemented for services?"
